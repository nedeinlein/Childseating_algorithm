# Childseating_algorithm
## During my time at Frontier, I was tasked with helping them to meet a new DOT requirement to sit children under 13 with an adult from their booking. I completed this algorithm in October of 2022.
## This process removed the requirement for either the passenger to select a seat during booking, which would have cost them money, and the manual process required of assigning passengers next to 
## each other by the gate agent, causing delays in boarding and creating uncertainty. As a result Frontier was at the time the only airline that automatically sat parents and children next to each other\
## for free.
